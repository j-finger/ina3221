# INA3221 Driver - `qfuse` Project - AS2 CC3501

This is a power monitoring driver for the INA3221 sensor. It is written in C++ and is designed to be used with the RP2040 microcontroller. It has been developed with the Pico SDK.

This repository is apart of the `qfuse` project for Assignment 2 of the subjcet CC3501 Computing Interface and Control at James Cook University.

It has been developed using functional programming and moved to OOP once functionality has been fleshed out. It is being developed in conjunction with my classmate and serves as the basis for him to get started on his scope of the project.
